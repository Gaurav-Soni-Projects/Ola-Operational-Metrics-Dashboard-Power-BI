# Ola-Operational-Metrics-Dashboard-Power-BI-

This project features a comprehensive Power BI dashboard designed to analyze key operational and financial metrics for a ridesharing company (Ola) over a one-month period (July 2024). The goal was to transform raw transactional data into actionable business intelligence, focusing on performance, customer experience, and revenue generation.

The dashboard allows stakeholders to monitor real-time (simulated) operational health and identify areas for strategic intervention.

💡 Key Features & Analysis Areas

The dashboard is structured into five main pages, each providing specialized insights:

Overall Performance: Tracks total bookings (over 103K), total booking value (35M), booking status breakdown, and ride volume trends over time.

Vehicle Type Analysis: Compares performance across different vehicle segments (Prime Sedan, Prime SUV, Mini, Auto, Bike, E-Bike) based on Total Booking Value, Success Booking Value, Average Distance Traveled, and Total Distance Traveled.

Revenue & Finance: Visualizes revenue breakdown by payment method (Cash and UPI dominance), tracks daily revenue stability, and identifies Top 5 Customers by booking value.

Cancellation Deep Dive: Calculates the overall 28.08% cancellation rate and provides a detailed breakdown of cancellation reasons, categorized by:

Customer-Initiated: Top reason identified as "Driver is not moving toward pickup" (30.24%).

Driver-Initiated: Top reason identified as "Personal & Car related issues" (35.49%).

Ratings & Quality: Displays average Driver Ratings and Customer Ratings across all vehicle types, showing consistent high scores (around 4.0).

🚀 Key Business Insights

Operational Bottleneck: The high cancellation rate and the leading customer-initiated reason ('Driver is not moving toward pickup') point to potential issues in driver allocation or real-time location tracking that require immediate attention.

Financial Trend: The reliance on Cash and UPI suggests a significant portion of the user base prefers non-card payment methods, which could inform financial infrastructure and marketing strategies.

Service Segmentation: Auto rides have a drastically lower average distance traveled (10.04 km) compared to other segments (≈25 km), confirming their primary use for short-distance local travel.
